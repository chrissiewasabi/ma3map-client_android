This is my atttempt in putting [Nairobi matatu transit route data](http://www.gtfs-data-exchange.com/agency/university-of-nairobi-c4dlab/) by [Digital Matatus](http://www.digitalmatatus.com/) to good use


## Android Client

The android client was made using [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/studio.html) and the [Gradle Build System](http://www.gradle.org/).
To correctly run this project, do:

    ./gradlew clean
    ./gradlew build --debug
